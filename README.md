# WebshareProxyRequester
This script allows you to send HTTP requests to a target URL through different proxies retrieved from Webshare.io over a period of time. It is especially useful for scenarios where you need to send a large number of requests to a target URL without hitting rate limits or to simulate traffic from different IPs.
